Nik challenged me to code a little automated script that would modify a given percentage of images in a request

[I did two sets - a folder with 2 %/10 images modified red] 
[a folder with 60 %/10 images mdified blue] 

[Second run - a folder wwith 20%/100 images modified red]
[a folder with 80 %/100 images modified Black]

Success.
